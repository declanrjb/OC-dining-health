<p>3717-1-03.4(G) / Ready-to-eat, time/temperature controlled for safety food - date marking.Critical Refrigerated, ready-to-eat, TCS foods held refrigerated for more than 24 hours were not properly date marked.</p>
<p>-Observed several undated, unlabeled, or mis-labeled food items in the walk-in cooler. To prevent foodborne illness, refrigerated, ready-to-eat, TCS food held at a temperature of 41°F or less for more than 24 hours shall be clearly marked at the time of preparation or the time the original container is opened to indicate the date or day, that is a maximum of seven days, by which the food shall be consumed, sold, or discarded. The day the food is prepared or opened is day one.</p>
<p>3717-1-04.4(L) / Mechanical warewashing equipment - hot water sanitization temperatureCritical The rinse temperature in a mechanical warewashing operation is not adequate to sanitize dishes and utensils.</p>
<p>-The irreversible temperature indicator strip did not change color indicating a plate-level temperature of 160F. Final rinse gauge read between 175F and 205F. Dish racks appeared to be pushed through prior to final rinse cycle activating. To prevent pathogen growth: in a mechanical operation, the temperature of the fresh hot water sanitizing rinse as it enters the manifold may not be more than 194˚F, or less than 180˚F.</p>
