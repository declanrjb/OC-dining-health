# Investigation into health code violations at Oberlin College

An April 9 inspection by Lorain County public health found multiple critical violations of health and safety codes at Stevenson Dining Hall and the Rathskeller. Inspectors cited the Rathskeller’s mechanical dishwasher for failing to reach the required water temperature for proper sanitization, while Stevenson received a third repeat violation for the presence of flies in and around the main kitchen’s sinks.
